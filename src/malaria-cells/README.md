# Detecting infected malaria cells with Python
This aims to group up all the repository algorithms (at least those which can
be used in classification problems) and test them in a real world scenario.

The data-set used here is pretty big, so to avoid getting a huge repository
size it will be ignored by the *.gitignore* file.
[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria)
you can download it. After that, place it under the `data/heavy/` folder
(create it if it doesn't exist), and rename it to `malaria-cells`.

The final path should look like this `data/heavy/malaria-cells/`, and it should
contain two folders with the images, respectively named `Parasitized` and
`Uninfected`.
