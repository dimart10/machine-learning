# Machine Learning algorithms in Python
Welcome! This repository is all about machine learning algorithms, using Python standard libraries such as numpy, matplotlib or scipy. Take a look around if you are interested, you can also [contribute](#contributing) if you feel like it.

## Getting Started
Keep reading if you want to know how to run any of the scripts.

### Prerequisites

- Any Python 3.X installation (*virtualenv* can come in handy to avoid messing with your OS packages).
- Python 3 standard libraries. It depends on the script you want to execute, but generally you'd want to have at least `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` and `scipy`.
- More advanced scripts may also use `scikit-learn` and `opencv`.

### Installing

Once you have your prerequisites installed:

- Download or clone this repository.
- Open a terminal at the folder of the script you want to run.
- Enter `python nameOfTheScript.py` or `python3 nameOfTheScript.py`.

If you run into any trouble, check you have installed all the packages included in the script. If that's
not the problem, please [open an issue or submit a pull request with the fix](#contributing).
